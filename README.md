# Fork

I forked this because the upstream provides default bindings that collide with several operations that I use regularly, mostly ***C-t*** (for swapping characters).

# Fzf

**fzf** provides efficient keybindings for the [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) utility. Heavily adapted from @hauleth's PR.

## Install

Minimum fish version: `2.2.0`
Compatible fzf versions: `0.11.3`

_That's the fzf version I'm using, and it works. If anyone gets it working on other versions, feel free to let me know/make a PR here._

With [Fisherman]

```
fisher install fzf
```

## Usage
- Ctrl-t: file finder (multi-select enabled)
- Ctrl-r: search past commands
- Ctrl-x: execute past commands without confirmation
- Alt-c: cd into directories

## Variables

### `FZF_TMUX`
If you're a [tmux] user, run `set -U FZF_TMUX 1`. This makes fish run the more tmux-compatible `fzf-tmux`.
